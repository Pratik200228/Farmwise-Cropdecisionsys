# 🌾 FarmWise AI

> An AI-Powered Crop Decision Support System for Small-Scale Farmers

Small and family farmers make high-stakes decisions every day — which crops to plant, when to sell, whether that yellowing leaf is a disease or just stress. FarmWise AI brings intelligent, affordable decision support directly to the farmers who need it most, no outside consultant required.

## What It Does

FarmWise AI combines three tightly integrated capabilities into a single visual dashboard:

**Crop Suitability Analysis** — A goal-based AI agent analyzes real-time environmental parameters (temperature, wind speed, humidity, rainfall, and soil conditions) and ranks crops by suitability score, complete with confidence levels and seasonal rotation suggestions.

**Market Price Prediction** — Live integrations with USDA Agricultural Marketing Service and commodity market APIs surface price forecasts, historical comparisons, and optimal selling windows so farmers stop guessing and start planning.

**Crop Health Monitoring** — PlantVillage and Plantix APIs power early-warning disease detection, pest identification, and growth-stage tracking before problems become losses.

The AI agent handles complex environmental reasoning. External APIs handle market and health data. Clear separation, reliable results.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Node.js 18+
- API keys for OpenWeatherMap, USDA AMS, and your chosen LLM provider

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env        # fill in your API keys
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`. Interactive docs at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

Opens at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Key Features

- **Ranked crop recommendations** with suitability scores based on live environmental data
- **Planting confidence levels** and seasonal rotation suggestions
- **Price forecasts** with optimal selling-window alerts
- **Disease and pest detection** with treatment recommendations
- **Early warning system** for emerging crop health issues
- **Simple visual dashboard** designed for farmers, not data scientists

## Evaluation

The system is tested against simulated farm scenarios covering a range of environmental conditions and crop types. Evaluation criteria include:

- Accuracy of crop suitability rankings vs. agronomic ground truth
- Price forecast precision against actual market outcomes
- Disease detection recall rate in health monitoring scenarios
- Dashboard usability with non-technical users

Results are documented in the final project report.
